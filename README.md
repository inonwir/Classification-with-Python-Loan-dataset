# Classification-with-Python-Loan-dataset
In this notebook we try to practice all the classification algorithms. We load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the following algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.

# About Dataset
This dataset is about past loans. The Loan_train.csv data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted.

# Classification 
We use the training set to build an accurate model. Then use the test set to report the accuracy of the model You should use the following algorithm:<br/>
- K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) <br/>
- Decision Tree <br/>
- SVM <br/>
- Logistic Regression<br/>
